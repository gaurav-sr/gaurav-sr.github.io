 I am starting this blog to share my knowledge and wisdom I have gathered over years of working in software development. 
 <br><br>
 I have not just worked but I have enjoyed. But to be honest there have been times when I did not enjoy what I was doing, hated what I was given to work on . I have slogged, sacrificed personal time, gained nothing but in the end I learned something. :-) And I have survived and will survive :-)
 <br>
 <br>
 In this blog I will cover topics which I use primarily use in my work like Java, Spring, SpringBoot, hibernate etc. Outside work , whenever I get time I try to learn something new . Like recently , I have been exploring golang and rust and the hot machine learning, blockchain etc. So , if I have something to share in this space I will put here.
 <br><br>
 Hope you will enjoy reading :-)
